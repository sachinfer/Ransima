        <p className="page-message">
          Welcome to the overview of backend API design. This page covers the fundamental aspects of designing robust and secure APIs.
        </p>
        <div className="info-section">
          <h2>What is API Design?</h2>
          <p>
            API (Application Programming Interface) design is a critical aspect of software development. It defines how different software systems interact with each other, allowing them to communicate and work together efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            A well-designed API should be intuitive and straightforward, enabling developers to integrate it seamlessly with their applications. It should also be scalable to accommodate future growth and changes.
          </p>
          <h2>Key Considerations in API Design</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Ensure that your API handles user authentication and authorization securely. Implement robust mechanisms to protect sensitive data and resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>CRUD Operations:</strong> Design APIs to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations effectively. This is the foundation of most interactions with your data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Provide clear and informative error messages. This helps developers understand issues and resolve them quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Documentation:</strong> Comprehensive documentation is essential. It should explain how to use the API, including endpoints, request formats, and response formats.
          </p>
          <h2>Extending Your API</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond basic CRUD operations, consider additional features such as:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Integrate payment gateways for financial transactions.</li>
              <li><strong>Report Generation:</strong> Provide endpoints for generating reports based on data.</li>
              <li><strong>Analytics Integration:</strong> Incorporate analytics tools to track usage and performance.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Regularly review and update your API to address new requirements and improve functionality. Test thoroughly to ensure reliability and performance.
